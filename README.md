# PaperLink

PaperLink is a digital platform that connects self-employed paper makers with material suppliers, creating an efficient marketplace for the paper-making industry. The platform is built using the MERN stack, Socket.IO for real-time communication, Material-UI (MUI) for a sleek and responsive user interface, Redux for state management, and Stripe for payment integration.
